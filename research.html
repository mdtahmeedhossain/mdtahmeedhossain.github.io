            <h2>Sporting Events and Road Accidents: A Case Study from NFL Games</h2>
            <p>Abstract: This paper examines the causal impact of major sporting events, which are known to elevate alcohol consumption and traffic congestion, on the incidence of traffic accidents. Utilizing the quasi-random nature of National Football League (NFL) game scheduling and an extensive accident dataset spanning from 2017 to 2022, I exploit within-region variation over time to estimate the effect of gamedays on accident rates. My main results indicate a 15.60% increase in traffic accidents within the 0-5 mile radius of the stadiums on game days. This effect is largely driven by an increase in accidents in the hours immediately preceding and following the games. Additionally, I find no significant changes in accident rates at the county level or in wider distance ranges from the stadiums.</p>

            <h2>The Effects of School Safety Tip Lines on Youth Suicide Prevention</h2>
            <p>Abstract: Suicidal deaths of high school-aged youths (14-to-18-year-olds) have almost doubled over the past decade. School safety tip lines, an anonymous reporting method that enables students to submit tips about their suicidal friends and classmates, have emerged as a potential solution to reduce youth suicide. Using data from the CDC's Multiple Causes of Death data for the period 1999-2018, this is the first study to formally investigate the effect of introducing school safety tip lines on youth suicide prevention. My primary identification strategy is a difference-in-differences (DID) method that exploits variation in the timing of the adoption of the safety tip lines across states. I also employ a synthetic control method (SCM) as an alternative identification strategy to compare suicide rates in Colorado and Michigan (early adopters of tip line mobile applications and websites) to non-adopting states before and after the adoption of tip lines. Despite the existence of anecdotal evidence of tip lines saving many high-school students from committing suicides, I find little evidence that tip lines have reduced completed suicides among 14-to-18-year-old youths.</p>

            <h2>Historical Religious Conflict and the Persistence of Communal Violence: Evidence from Temple Destruction in Medieval India</h2>
            <p>Abstract: This paper examines the long-term impact of historical religious conflicts on contemporary communal violence in India. I exploit the destruction of Hindu temples by medieval Muslim rulers as a historical shock to Hindu-Muslim relations and investigate its persistent effects using district-level data on religious violence from 1950 to 1995. My results indicate that districts where temples were historically destroyed experienced a nearly sevenfold increase in communal violence compared to unaffected districts, alongside heightened Hindu-Muslim occupational and residential segregation, suggesting long-term socio-economic fragmentation. The historical shock appears to specifically affect religious conflict, as I find no significant effect on non-communal violence. To strengthen causal identification, I employ an instrumental variables strategy based on least-cost paths of medieval military campaigns determined by geographical features, using high-resolution spatial data on terrain constraints, river networks, and strategic military considerations. This approach aims to address potential endogeneity concerns and isolate the causal effect of historical religious conflict on contemporary outcomes. I further implement Nevo and Rosen's (2012) bounds approach, which allows for partial violations of the exclusion restriction while still producing informative bounds on the causal effect.</p>
