        <h2>Historical Religious Conflict and the Persistence of Communal Divisions: Evidence from Temple Destruction in Medieval India (Job Market Paper) <a href="https://smu.box.com/s/aim4ung064yvl5xvurnmconh7zrvuvu0" class="paper-link">(Latest Version)</a></h2>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">Abstract: I use proximity to least-cost paths of medieval Muslim military campaigns as an instrumental variable to examine the long-run impacts of temple destruction in India between the 11th and 16th centuries. Districts exposed to temple destruction experience at least 160 percent more Hindu-Muslim communal violence in the post-independence period (1950-1995). This persistence operates through lasting social fragmentation: affected districts exhibit higher employment and residential segregation between Hindu and Muslim communities, and greater spatial separation of religious institutions, despite being more economically developed today.</p>

        <h2>Sporting Events and Road Accidents: A Case Study from NFL Games <a href="papers/paper1.pdf" class="paper-link">(Latest Version)</a></h2>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">Abstract: This paper examines the causal impact of major sporting events, which are known to elevate alcohol consumption and traffic congestion, on the incidence of traffic accidents. Utilizing the quasi-random nature of National Football League (NFL) game scheduling and an extensive accident dataset spanning from 2017 to 2022, I exploit within-region variation over time to estimate the effect of gamedays on accident rates. My main results indicate a 15.60% increase in traffic accidents within the 0-5 mile radius of the stadiums on game days. This effect is largely driven by an increase in accidents in the hours immediately preceding and following the games. Additionally, I find no significant changes in accident rates at the county level or in wider distance ranges from the stadiums.</p>

        <h2>The Effects of School Safety Tip Lines on Youth Suicide Prevention <a href="papers/paper2.pdf" class="paper-link">(Latest Version)</a></h2>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">Abstract: Suicidal deaths of high school-aged youths (14-to-18-year-olds) have almost doubled over the past decade. School safety tip lines, an anonymous reporting method that enables students to submit tips about their suicidal friends and classmates, have emerged as a potential solution to reduce youth suicide. Using data from the CDC's Multiple Causes of Death data for the period 1999-2018, this is the first study to formally investigate the effect of introducing school safety tip lines on youth suicide prevention. My primary identification strategy is a difference-in-differences (DID) method that exploits variation in the timing of the adoption of the safety tip lines across states. I also employ a synthetic control method (SCM) as an alternative identification strategy to compare suicide rates in Colorado and Michigan (early adopters of tip line mobile applications and websites) to non-adopting states before and after the adoption of tip lines. Despite the existence of anecdotal evidence of tip lines saving many high-school students from committing suicides, I find little evidence that tip lines have reduced completed suicides among 14-to-18-year-old youths.</p>
